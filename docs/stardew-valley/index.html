    <p>This calculator makes a few assumptions, some of which are atypical:</p>
<ul>
<li>All crops are planted only once, and watered until no longer productive.
<ul>
<li>This means that crops that don't regrow are not replanted, even if there would be time to do so.</li>
<li>This affects how we compute &quot;daily&quot; profit. We only count the days that you'd need to water plant, to avoid penalizing crops that don't fit evenly into the season.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All seeds are bought from Pierre's, except those that can't. For those, I selected a seed cost in an arbitrary way.
<ul>
<li>Ancient Fruit, Broccoli, Carrot, Powdermelon, Summer Squash: must be foraged. Labeled as 0g for now, but will be updated to use Seed Maker cost later.</li>
<li>Coffee Beans: cost of a normal-quality harvested bean (15g)</li>
<li>Pineapple, Taro Root: must be obtained via trade; cost is the cost of the traded goods (Magma Cap and 2x Bone Fragment, respectively)</li>
<li>Tea Leaves: must be crafted, set cost to 0g.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All crops that can be irrigated are (Rice, Taro Root)</li>
<li>Giant Crops are not considered</li>
<li>All crops are available to purchase (i.e., we don't track the fact that Garlic is not available until Year 2)</li>
<li>Sunflowers are put into the Seed Maker before being put into the Oil Maker</li>
</ul>
